### **What is it?**

Gerrymandering refers to the manipulation of the boundaries of an electoral district in order to provide unfair advantage for a certain political party.

### **Where did it come from?**

The practice of district manipulation is about as old as party politics in the United States. Under the Constitution, states redistrict every ten years after the completion of the census. The power of districting has most often been in the hands of state legislatures whose ruling parties have, in many cases, attempted to perpetuate power through unfair electoral maps. The term was born in 1812 when the Governor of Massachusetts Elbridge Gerry signed a bill that created a district designed to benefit his Democratic-Republican Party over the opposing Federalists. The Boston Gazette coined the term on March 26th, 1812, which noted that the odd-looking district resembled a salamander, and thus referred to the blatantly unfair move as a “Gerry-mander.” The term now refers to any attempt to gain political advantage through districting.

### Why is it a big deal?

Unfair districting makes elected officials less directly accountable to their constituents and more likely to represent political views that are radically to one side of the political spectrum. This is because officials are less concerned about serious challenges from opposing parties, and more concerned about challenges from within their own parties. As such, legislatures become less representative of the popular will and less likely to listen to varying opinions within the districts they are meant to represent. In addition to these issues, minority communities are disproportionately affected by gerrymandering, and are often stripped of power by maps that separate or pack-in their votes. This system, in effect, makes life easier for those already in power and makes change much more difficult.

### How does it work?

Gerrymandering provides political advantage through what is known as the Wasted Vote Effect. Unfair districting increases the number of “wasted votes,” which are votes that do not help to elect a candidate. By packing certain voters into districts, parties can contain opposition votes to districts the other party would have won any way and prevent serious competition in other districts.

### What can be done?

The most clear-cut solution for gerrymandering is the use of independent commissions rather that elected bodies to draw maps for states. California, after seeing only one district change hands from 2000 to 2010, had a referendum which resulted in the state outsourcing the creation of new districts to the California Citizens Redistricting Commission. This has resulted in the creation of several highly competitive seats.
